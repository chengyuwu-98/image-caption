# Image Captioning including Attention

The product is designed for disabled people, who cannot see the pictures but can listen to the description. We are aiming to enable disabled people to access more information and experience the beauty of the world. Our product can predict the captioning of an image and display to users. A user can upload an image and play the audio of the captioning of the image, so that they can "hear" the image. Our [Website](http://35.202.212.110:8080/) is available!

### How to trigger Continous Deliveryï¼š
Once you update the code for application, run `git tag <tagname>` `git push origin <tagname>` the Cloud Build will automatically begin and the application will update.
Therefore, we can make sure every time there is a new version of our application, it can update automatically.


## Load test
